Core of Light personal assitant. It aims to provide fast and neat way to parse user input, execute it and return result to Light. 
Because Light is being develop separately for NativeScript and Electron developing its core as a separate module helps preventing messy code and git submodule makes things even more orgainsed and easier to maintain.
